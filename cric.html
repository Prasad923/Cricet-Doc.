<p>hat feels like a good place to sign off for the series. <b>From our various commentators</b> and scorers throughout <br>the series - Alan, Miller, Karthik, Varun, Raghav, Chandan, myself and various others, thanks for tuning into our live coverage throughout. We'll be back with some more live cricket very soon, with England's first ODI against Ireland on Thursday, and we look forward to having you with us then. Cheers!</p>
<p>Root picks up the Wisden Trophy and holds it aloft, all on his own, as though it's the Champions League. No champagne, no big team photo, no autographs and selfies with fans. That's England's forever, <br>with a Richards/Botham Trophy being commissioned in its place.</p>
